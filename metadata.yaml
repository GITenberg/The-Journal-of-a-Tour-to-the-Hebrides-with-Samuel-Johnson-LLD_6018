description: "The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides with Samuel Johnson, LL.D. is\
  \ a travel journal by Scotsman James Boswell first published in 1785. In 1773, Boswell\
  \ enticed his English friend Samuel Johnson to accompany him on a tour through the\
  \ highlands and western islands of Scotland. Johnson was then in his mid sixties\
  \ and well known for his literary works and his Dictionary. The two travellers set\
  \ out from Edinburgh and skirted the eastern and northeastern coasts of Scotland,\
  \ passing through St Andrews, Aberdeen and Inverness. They then passed into the\
  \ highlands and spent several weeks on various islands in the Hebrides, including\
  \ Skye, Coll, and Mull. After a visit to Boswell's estate at Auchinleck, the travellers\
  \ returned to Edinburgh. Johnson published his Journey to the Western Islands of\
  \ Scotland on 18 January 1775.\nIt was widely read, discussed and criticised, especially\
  \ for some skeptical remarks Johnson made questioning the authenticity of the Ossian\
  \ poems, which were then all the rage. After Johnson's death in 1784, Boswell published\
  \ his Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides. This work was based on a diary Boswell\
  \ had kept during the 1773 tour and included detailed descriptions of where he and\
  \ Johnson had gone and what Johnson had said.\nThe Journal served as a teaser for\
  \ the longer biography Boswell was preparing for publication, his Life of Samuel\
  \ Johnson, which would exhibit the same qualities. Boswell's Journal and Johnson's\
  \ Journey make an interesting study in contrasts. Johnson considers things philosophically\
  \ and maintains a high level of generality. Boswell's approach is more anecdotal,\
  \ even gossipy, and succeeds in large part because of Boswell's keen eye and ear\
  \ for detail. Both accounts are still widely read and admired today.\n From Wikipedia\
